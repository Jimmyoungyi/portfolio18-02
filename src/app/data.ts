		conclusion: "This project is my final thesis of my master degree. I really learn a lot from this project. It really surprises me when I just open the oldest folder and see what have I done at that time. Here is an example of how I improved. At the beginning, I really focus on functions. I add a lot of functions in my app. That makes the app really complex. Then I realize that an app should focus on key functions instead of everything can be done. I start to simplify the app. However, I still focus on this app itself. With the time pass, I start to realize that users are the most important part for an app. I should focus on how a user feels instead of how functional the app is. So I start to focus on design challenges and how can I make this app more friendly."

So when it makes development much faster and easier."
